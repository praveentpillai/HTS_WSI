# HTS_WSI

The code files contained in this repository are used to implement the method 'Full Image Tissue Mask Segmentation' (FITMG) and 'Region Specific Tissue Mask Generation' (RSTMG) using the 'Scale-based Pixel Transformation Equation' (SPTE) as elaborated in the paper 'Heuristic based Tissue Segmentation of Giga-pixel Whole Slide Images'.

The file Full_Image_Mask_Generation.ipynb implements FITMG while Patchwise_Mask_Generation.ipynb implements RSTMG.

The way of using the codes are elaborated in the respective files.
