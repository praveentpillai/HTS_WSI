# HTS_WSI

The code files contained in this repository are used to implement the method 'Full Image Tissue Mask Segmentation' (FITMG) described in the research paper 'Heuristic based Tissue Segmentation of Giga-pixel Whole Slide Images'. FITMG segments the tissue area of a given high-resolution WSI image from its relatively lower resolution thumbnail image. The file Full_Image_Mask_Generation.ipynb implements FITMG and the procedures for adapting the codes are elaborated in the respective files.

The dataset for working with the code can be downloaded from the Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bDVN1qUpeaAoy3bRO52PEgKJC2PViuH?usp=sharing. Downloaded it to a directory and appropriately set the path in the file. The code has been tested on the Google Colab environment without any GPU support.
